# Nuxt 3 Minimal Recreation of Generate Failure

This is a minimal project to recreate random generation failures for a static site for cloudflare pages. tester.sh will run "pnpm generate" 100 times and report the percentage of failures.

Default project created with "pnpm dlx nuxi@latest init pages-fail". Succeeded 100/100 times. This is the expected result.
